            <p>Hey<span role="img" aria-label="hello">ðŸ‘‹</span>. My name is Ibrahim Adeyemi a.k.a debugger<span role="img" aria-label="debugger">ðŸ¤–</span> , I'm a 23 year old Front end developer based in Nigeria. 
                I have developed great passion in doing what i find most enjoyable, satisfying and meaningful, which is coding.
                it has offered me a fulfilling creative path of problem solving, a field that is ever evolving, challenging and requires constant effort in expanding your knowledge.
                <br /><br />So i'm eager to keep learning more advanced concepts and frameworks. I'm interested in building aesthetically pleasing and interactive websites that are accessible and deliver a great user experience. Apart from broadening my coding knowledge I'd love to learn more about UX/UI design.
                <br /><br />
                
                Having managed & delivered a several project, collaborate with other developers on projects and undergone a few FrontEnd Web Development internships,
                these given a focus on team building & collaboration and equipped me with good problem-solving skills and trained me to work well under pressure to meet tight timelines. 
                Outside of coding,     </p>
